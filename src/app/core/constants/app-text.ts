      "TITLE": "Hair Kinetics™ by Joseph Battisti",
      "DESCRIPTION_1": "Hair Kinetics™ is a cutting and styling methodology developed by Joseph Battisti that focuses on the natural movement and structure of hair. The technique is based on cutting the hair where it naturally falls, rather than forcing direction or shape. This approach allows the hair to grow out evenly, maintain balance, and move with ease, reducing the need for constant maintenance.",
      "DESCRIPTION_2": "Unlike traditional methods that rely on matching hairstyles to standard face shapes, Hair Kinetics™ customizes every cut to the client's unique bone structure and hair behavior. By integrating precision cutting with modern deconstruction techniques, the result is a style that looks intentional, structured, and naturally dynamic.",
      "COMMITMENT": {
        "TITLE": "OUR COMMITMENT",

Each cut, treatment, and style is approached as a layered design, technically sound, sustainable, and personalized to the individual."

      "BIO_3": "He also develops advanced hair systems, including human-hair keratin treatments and extensions such as Miniveils and Hairbit, enhancing strength, texture, and flexibility while preserving the hair's natural integrity.
